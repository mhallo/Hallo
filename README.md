Personal project with Vue.js and yarn.  Hopefully can evolve into a personal webpage.
Keeping expectations modest as I will revisit and revise a couple of times.

# TODO:
* Setup structure of pages dependent on goals
* Decide on Transition of things
* Add content
* AJAX other stuff?
* Style, style, style.

## Page Structure: 
One page:  scroll to load contents.  Lazy load the section you need.
